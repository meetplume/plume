## Step 1 
We have a landing page which belongs to the playground.
It allows to navigate to 2 pages, which are defined routes in the playground, but the rendering is already being made in Plume.
It allows to render 2 different pages, and we provide the Props for that pages.
We're not sure if we're integrating 100% of Inertia, but in this step, yes.
The next step is to improve pages that we can render, with some nice couple (2 or 3) sections.
